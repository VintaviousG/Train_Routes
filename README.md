# Train_Routes

This our first assignment in Data Structures. We were given a map with train stations like the one below:
![Routes](https://github.com/VintaviousG/Train_Routes/blob/master/Train_Routes.png?raw=true)

## Story
For this assignment, the program needs to ask for 2 train stations and output the complete route the train stations were on. The map above has 3 routes. For example, If both the station the user enter are Germania and F on Route 2, the output would be:
![Routes_Output](https://github.com/VintaviousG/Train_Routes/blob/master/TrainRoutes_Output.png?raw=true)
